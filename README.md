# Cyber-Security-Projects
This repository is a collection of cybersecurity projects aimed at helping me gain hands-on experience. While my ultimate goal is to become a Penetration Tester, my current plan is to start as a SOC analyst. I believe gaining blue-team experience is essential because understanding the common layout of network security and familiarizing myself with common FW/IDS/IPS rules will enable me to strategize ways to quietly attack systems without triggering alarms
